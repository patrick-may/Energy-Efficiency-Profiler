# Profiling Programs for Energy Efficiency

## Overview
Within software engineering, there are increasing motivations to consider energy consumption when designing software.
Sometimes, it is direct energy consumption cost, although this tends to only be a consideration for heavy computing datacenters.
Others care about energy efficiency because it has direct impact on the consumer. For example, laptop and mobile computing have real life battery considerations that can be designed for. While many of these optimizations and energy considerations are left to hardware, operating systems, and compiler engineers, there is a growing argument that even end designers should be desiging with energy consumption as a consideration.
Finally - this type of project lets you (the user!) feel smart and eco-friendly, as less energy is literally less pollutants used. 

## Purpose
This project exists to serve as a diagnostic tool for understanding with, greater granularity, the energy consumption of different portions of a particular program. It aims to some-what repurpose existing profiling tools to also report on energy consumption of different portions of the program.
